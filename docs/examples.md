# Examples

This project includes several example scripts under `examples/`:

- `rc_highpass.py` — RC highpass netlist builder
- `opamp_closed_loop.py` — simple op-amp closed-loop example
- `monte_carlo_demo.py` — demo running monte_carlo with a fake runner

You can run them directly with Python, for example:

```bash
python -m examples.rc_highpass
```

Or view the source in the `examples/` folder for more advanced usage.
