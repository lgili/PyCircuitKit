# Component library

An updated component library reference is coming soon. For now, browse
`spicelab/core/components.py` and the [`docs/components.md`](components.md)
quick tour for examples of resistors, capacitors, controlled sources, ideal
op-amps, and the analog multiplexer.

If you add custom components, register them in your own module and expose them
ahead of simulation. A future release will include full documentation and typed
registries for custom factories.
